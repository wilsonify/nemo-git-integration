# Get Started 

Ensure you're running **Debian** with **Cinnamon** as your window manager and **Nemo** as your file explorer.

```
make install    # Copies *.nemo_action files to the ~/.local/share/nemo/actions folder
make uninstall  # Removes installed actions
```

1. use debian as your operating system. probably works with red hat but it is not tested.  

2. use cinnnamon as you windows manager  

3. use nemo as your file explorer.
   
5. copy all *.nemo_action files to your ~/.local/share/nemo/actions or ```make install``` as mentioned above.

6. Zenity is used for graphical dialogs. if you don't have it then you can install it with apt ```sudo apt install zenity```
 
7. nemo-python is used for nemo extension columns. if you don't have it then you can install it with apt ```sudo apt install nemo-python```

## Testing

Scripts under `tests/` use [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for shell testing. Each test corresponds to a script under `nemo-git-integration/`.

```bash
make dev # installs bats
make test # bats tests/*
```


# Action Syntax Cheatsheet

Some useful nemo_action stuff to help understand the code

%P: This placeholder represents the full path to the directory containing the selected file or folder. This ensures that the command navigates to the correct directory before executing the Git command.

%F: This represents the full path to the selected file.

%N: This represents the filename without the path, useful for commit messages.

## valid Selection(s)

s: Action is available when only one item is selected.

m: Action is available when multiple items are selected.

a: Action is available when one or more items are selected.

f: Action is available when files are selected.

d: Action is available when directories are selected.

You can combine these values to create more specific conditions. For example:

af: Action is available when one or more files are selected.

ad: Action is available when one or more directories are selected.

adf: Action is available when one or more directories or files are selected.

# Explanation

"$1" is the path to the current directory (%P in .nemo_action).

"$@" handles the selected files (%F in .nemo_action).

Uses zenity --question to confirm reset, which is destructive.

Aggregates errors to show at the end if anything failed.
